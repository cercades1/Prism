## Introduction
Overview: This workshop will focus on how to choose an appropriate statistical test given data and hypothesis. It will include a hands on section for attendees to practice how to run these tests using Prism.
Specific topic include the following: unpaired t-test, paired t-test, ordinary one-way ANOVA, repeated measures one-way ANOVA and non-parametric tests, Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. It time allows, we will do include an advanced problem to solve at the end of the workshop.
 
Pre-Requirements: Ideally attendees will have basic familiarity with Prism and background knowledge of Statistics, for example, how to develop hypothesis, what is normal distribution, p-value and etc. However, this is not required, if you are interested in this topic, please don’t hesitate to join us!
