### Objectives:
1.	How to create graphs in Prism 
2.	How to change a graph
3.	Breaking Y axis into two segments
4.	Graphing Example: XY plots â€“ Nonlinear curve fitting
5.	Exporting images from Prism

### Conclusion:
It is really complicated to create a graph template to be applied to all situations. It is better to think about what you would like to include in your graph and how you would like to present them. The best way might be checking how other people present their results in this area.
